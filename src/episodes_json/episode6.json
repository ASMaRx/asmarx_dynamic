I hope.<br><br>Though they're diminished by the fact that I exported the episode wrong and might have lost some fidelity...<br><br>For some actual content, I also read some excerpts of Marx's texts where he critiques other thinkers, including:<br>Ludwig Feuerbach, Max Stirner, and Mikhail Bakunin.<br>I have included a convenient file in case you want to get straight to the roasts!",
